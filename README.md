# ComputerGuessTheNumber
A game where the user is prompted to choose a number between 1 and 100. The program then guesses the users number, and the user can provide feedback such as higher or lower. When the program guesses the number correctly, the user can tell the program. The program then prints a happy message and the amount of guesses it took. Then the program asks if the user wants to play again, choosing “Y” loops through the game again, choosing “N” ends the program.
